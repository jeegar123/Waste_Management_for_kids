        <h1>Introduction — All About Waste.</h1>
        <p>Waste has been a major environmental issue everywhere since the industrial revolution.
            Besides the waste we create at home, school and other public places, there are also
            those from hospitals, industries, farms and other sources. Humans rely so much on
            material things and they all (almost) end up as waste. And hey — where does the waste
            end up?</p>
        <h1>What is waste (trash, garbage, rubbish, refuse)</h1>
        <h5>What is the difference between trash and garbage?</h5>
        <p>Trash: Solid waste form places like your atic, backyard or study. Trash items include
            paper and card boxes and the like.</p>
        <p> Garbage: This is waste from kitchen and bathroom. They also include waste from cooking
            food and from food storage facilities.</p>
        <p>Waste are items we (individuals, offices, schools, industries, hospitals) don’t need and
            discard. Sometimes there are things we have that the law requires us to discard because
            they can be harmful. Waste comes in infinite sizes—some can be as small as an old
            toothbrush, or as large as the body of a school bus.</p>

    <h1>Types of waste</h1>
    <p>Generally, waste could be liquid or solid waste. Both of them could be hazardous. Liquid and
        solid waste types can also be grouped into organic, re-usable and recyclable waste.
        Let us see some details below:</p>
    <h1>Liquid type:</h1>
    <p>Waste can come in non-solid form. Some solid waste can also be converted to a liquid waste
        form for disposal. It includes point source and non-point source discharges such as storm
        water and wastewater. Examples of liquid waste include wash water from homes, liquids used
        for cleaning in industries and waste detergents.</p>
    <h1>Solid type:</h1>
    <p>Solid waste predominantly, is any garbage, refuse or rubbish that we make in our homes and
        other places. These include old car tires, old newspapers, broken furniture and even food
        waste. They may include any waste that is non-liquid.</p>
    <h1>Hazardous type:</h1>
    <p>Hazardous or harmful waste are those that potentially threaten public health or the
        environment. Such waste could be inflammable (can easily catch fire), reactive (can easily
        explode), corrosive (can easily eat through metal) or toxic (poisonous to human and
        animals). In many countries, it is required by law to involve the appropriate authority to
        supervise the disposal of such hazardous waste. Examples include fire extinguishers, old
        propane tanks, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment (e.g, thermostats) and lamps (e.g.
        fluorescent bulbs) and batteries.</p>
    <h1>Organic type:</h1>
    <p>Organic waste comes from plants or animals sources. Commonly, they include food waste, fruit
        and vegetable peels, flower trimmings and even dog poop can be classified as organic waste.
        They are biodegradable (this means they are easily broken down by other organisms over time
        and turned into manure). Many people turn their organic waste into compost and use them in
        their gardens.</p>
    <h1>Recyclable type:</h1>
    <p>Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new, useful products. This is done to
        reduce the use of raw materials that would have been used. Waste that can be potentially
        recycled is termed "Recyclable waste". Aluminum products (like soda, milk and tomato cans),
        Plastics (grocery shopping bags, plastic bottles), Glass products (like wine and beer
        bottles, broken glass), Paper products (used envelopes, newspapers and magazines, cardboard
        boxes) can be recycled and fall into this category.</p>

    <h1>Sources of waste Municipal sources of waste:</h1>
    <p>This includes trash or garbage from households, schools, offices, market places, restaurants
        and other public places.They include everyday items like food debris, used plastic bags,
        soda cans and plastic water bottles, broken furniture, grass clippings, product packaging,
        broken home appliances and clothing.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src=".//img/municiapl-solid-waste-composition.jpg"/>
    <h1> Medical/Clinical sources of waste</h1>
    <p>Medical/clinical waste, normally refers to waste produced from health care facilities, such
        as hospitals, clinics, surgical theaters, veterinary hospitals and labs. They tend to be
        classified as hazard waste rather than general waste.Items in this group include surgical
        items, pharmaceuticals, blood, body parts, wound dressing materials, needles and syringes
    </p>
    <h1>Agricultural sources of waste:</h1>
    <p>Typically, this is waste generated by agricultural activities. These include horticulture,
        fruit growing, seed growing, livestock breeding, market gardens and seedling nurseries.Waste
        items in this group include empty pesticide containers, old silage wrap, out of date
        medicines and wormers, used tires, surplus milk, cocoa pods and corn husks.</p>
    <h1>End-of-life Automobiles:</h1>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="./img/junk-and-car-scrap.jpg"/>
    <p>When cars are all old and not working again, where do they end up? Many people just leave
        them to rust in the fields, but there is a better way to deal with them. In many cities,
        these vehicles are sent to the plant, where all the removable parts are taken out for
        recycling. The rest is flattened up and shredded into peices for recycling. The last bits
        that cannot be used again is sent to a landfill.</p>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="tabcontent" id="wd" style="height:100%;">
    <h1>How is waste treated and disposed off?</h1>
    <p>Waste management simply means the collection, transport, processing or disposal, managing and
        monitoring of waste materials to minimize its' consequences on humans and environment.</p>
    <img alt="" src="./img/recycling-truck.jpg"/>
    <p>There are several methods of managing all the various types of waste. Some of these methods
        cause additional harm to the environment, but not doing anything is not an option.Let us see
        below two common ways of managing waste:</p>
    <h1>Incineration method of waste management:</h1>
    <p>This simply means burning waste. This method is common in countries with limited landfill
        space. Incineration chambers can be small for domestic use, but ther are large ones for
        municipal use as well. It is great for treating waste with contamination (like those from
        hospitals) and hazardous waste from factories, but the method produces too much carbon
        dioxide . Modern incineration processes are more efficient and release less dioxin than home
        fireplaces and backyard barbecues. This method is very common in Denmark, Germany and the
        Netherlands. This method is effective, but expensive.</p>
    <h1>Sanitary Landfills as waste disposal:</h1>
    <p>Generally, this term means a large piece of land away from living places where all the waste
        from a town is deposited. But there is more to landfills. Proper landfill management
        involves sorting out all the waste (waste separation), and sending only the waste that
        cannot be recycled and composted to the site.Proper landfills, are also lined at the bottom
        to minimize the leakage of soil pollutants and other toxins from getting into the water
        table. This method is effective, but expensive and difficult.In many towns, sorting is not
        done, and all the waste (paper, food, diapers, glass) is mixed up and deposited. That is a
        problem because, glass, and plastics take thousands of years to decompose. Additionally, the
        landfills soon become full, smelly and unsafe for the environment.Proper waste management is
        not cheap, but it is something we all have to get involved and discuss it. The effect of not
        getting involved can be catastrophic to our health and environment. Read about waste source
        reduction here</p>

<div class="tabcontent" id="recycle" style="height:100%;">
    <h1>What is Waste Recycling?</h1>
    <p>Recycling is processing used materials (waste) into new, useful products. This is done to
        reduce the use of raw materials that would have been used. Recycling also uses less energy
        and and great way of controlling air, water and land pollution.

        Effective recycling starts with household (or the place where the waste was created). In
        many serious countries, the authorities help households with bin bags with labels on them.
        Households then sort out the waste themselves and place them in the right bags for
        collection. This makes the work less difficult.</p>
    <img alt="" src="./img/recycling-for-kids.jpg">
    <h1>Paper waste:</h1>
    <p>Paper waste items include books, newspapers, magazines, cardboard boxes and envelopes.</p>
    <h1>Plastic waste:</h1>
    <p>Items include plastic bags, water bottles, rubber bags and plastic wrappers.</p>
    <h1>Glass waste:</h1>
    <p>All glass products like broken bottles, beer and wine bottles can be recycled.</p>
    <h1>Aluminium waste:</h1>
    <p>Cans from soda drink, tomato, fruit cans and all other cans can be recycled.</p>
    <p>When these are collected, the are sent to the recycling unit, where all the waste from each
        type are combined, crushed, melted and processed into new materials.</p>

    <h1>Importance and benefits of waste recycling</h1>
    <h3>Recycling helps protect the environment:</h3>
    <p>This is because the recyclable waste materials would have been burned or ended up in the
        landfill. Pollution of the air, land, water and soil is reduced.</p>
    <h3>Recycling conserves natural resources:</h3>
    <p>Recycling more waste means that we do not depend too much on raw (natural) resources, which
        are already massively depleted.</p>
    <h3>Recycling saves energy:</h3>
    <p>It takes more energy to produce items with raw materials than from recycling used materials.
        This means we are more energy efficient and the prices of products can come down.</p>
    <h3>Recycling creates jobs:</h3><br>
    <p> People are employed to collect, sort and work in recycling companies. Others also get jobs
        with businesses that work with these recycling units. There can be a ripple of jobs in the
        municipality.</p>

<div class="tabcontent" id="eofw" style="height:100%;">
    <h1>Effects of poor waste disposal.</h1>
    <p>Imagine we all throw garbage, junk and rubbish away anyhow. Imagine there was no authority to
        supervise waste management activities from all the sources mentioned earlier. Imagine we all
        just sent our rubbish to the landfill, or just dumped them in a nearby river. What do you
        think will happen? A disaster!</p>
    <h1>Environmental Effects</h1>
    <h3>Surface water contamination:</h3>
    <p>Waste that end up in water bodies negatively change the chemical composition of the water.
        Technically, this is called water pollution. This will affect all ecosystems existing in the
        water. It can also cause harm to animals that drink from such polluted water.</p>
    <h3>Soil contamination:</h3>
    <p>Hazardous chemicals that get into the soil (contaminants) can harm plants when they take up
        the contamination through their roots. If humans eat plants and animals that have been in
        contact with such polluted soils, there can be negative impact on their health.</p>
    <h3>Pollution:</h3>
    <p>Bad waste management practices can result in land and air pollution and can cause respiratory
        problems and other adverse health effects as contaminants are absorbed from the lungs into
        other parts of the body.</p>
    <h3>Leachate</h3>
    <p>Liquid that forms as water trickles through contaminated areas is called Leachate. It forms
        very harmful mixture of chemicals that may result in hazardous substances entering surface
        water, groundwater or soil.</p>
    <h1>Economic Effects</h1>
    <h3>Municipal wellbeing:</h3>
    <p>Everyone wants to live and visit places that are clean, fresh and healthy. A city with poor
        sanitation, smelly and with waste matter all over the place do not attract good people,
        investors and tourists. Such cities tend to have poor living standards.</p><br>
    <h3>Recycling revenue:</h3>
    <p>Cities that do not invest in recycling and proper waste control miss out on revenue from
        recycling. They also miss out on job opportunities that come from recycling, composting and
        businesses that work with them.</p>
